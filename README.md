# Dobročinné aukce/Charity Auction Website
A final project for the WEB Digital Academy in Czechitas: a Czech non-profit that aims to educate, inspire and apply new (mainly female) talents in IT and build a community around it.

## Project Description

We created an auction web prototype to be used by a single non-profit organisation that wants to organise its own auctions for charitable purposes. Thanks to the technology used, the website allows placing bids from multiple computers for the items available on the website. 

Instead of creating a fictional non-profit and its logo to act as an owner of the website, we asked an existing Prague based Hong-kongese NGO to use their logos, colors, and contact information for the purpose of the project.

### Technologies used

 -> React framework
 -> HTML/CSS
 -> Javascript
 -> Firebase/Firestore
 -> JSON

## What our application does?

In order to place bids, potential bidders must sign in via the form and fill out all mandatory fields.

Each auction has a coundown timer that updates every minute for the users to see how much time is left until the auctions are closed.

You can either place a minimum bid available for a specific item by clicking a direct button to place such a bid or type in an amount of your preference and then hit a button to place a bid.

All of the data, registration details of users, and bidding amounts are stored in Firestore.

### UX/UI Design and CSS

We opted for a minimal, eye-pleasing design that can be easily taken over by any non-profit when minor changes in color/font/logos are applied.

### Installation instructions

Clone the Github project

run npm install

We started off the project by running npm create-czechitas-app
